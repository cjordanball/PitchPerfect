# PitchPerfect
Intro iOS/Swift App for Udacity Course

PitchPerfect is an app created as the initial project for a course I am taking on Udacity.  Although fairly straightforward, it is more advanced than the typical "Goodbye, Cruel World" application that is often created as an initial project.  In particular, it incorporates the following:
- multiple view controllers, a navigation controller and a segue from one scene to the next,
- fairly extensive use of AVFoundation, although much of that is in the nature of cutting & pasting code presented,
- use of protocols, including delegate protocols and delegation,
- basic auto layout, including constraints and Stack Views,
- connecting Views with View Controllers via IBActions and IBOutlets
